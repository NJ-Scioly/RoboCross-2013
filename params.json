This repository is for the 2013 Science Olympiad RoboCross event!\r\n\r\n### Putting it together\r\nCircuit:\r\n* Servos:\r\n  * +5V to red wire (external source recommended to reduce jitter, I just cut out a USB wire)\r\n  * Ground to black (if an external source is being used, it's ground should also be connected to the arduino's ground, all the grounds must connect)\r\n  * Pins defined in setup() function, these may be redefined!\r\n\r\n* Nunchuk: (reference this pinout: http://voidbot.net/images/pinout-nunchuck-wii-motion-connector.jpg )\r\n  * Analog 5 to Clock (yellow wire)\r\n  * Analog  4 to Data (green wire)\r\n  * +3.3V to power (red wire) (+5V will work, but may lower your controllers lifespan, better safe than sorry)\r\n  * Ground to GND (back wire)\r\n\r\n* [Optional] Decoupling Caps\r\n  * Attach various capacitors between +5V and GND and between +3.3V and GND, this will reduce jitter\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Nj-scioly\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
